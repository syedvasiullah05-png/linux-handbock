# Linux Server Setup – DevOps Bundle

Contains scripts and configs for:
- User & group setup
- Directory permissions
- Package installation
- Cron backups, log cleanup, health checks
- System monitoring
- Systemd application service
- SSH Hardening
- LVM storage setup
- Firewall rules
- Logrotate configuration

Run scripts with:
    chmod +x <script>.sh
    ./<script>.sh



    Here’s a **very simple, child-like explanation** (as you prefer) + also clear **DevOps-level explanation**.

# 🌱 **What is Linux? (Simple Explanation)**

Think of **Linux like a big computer playground**.

* It is an **Operating System** (like Windows or macOS).
* It helps your computer **run programs**, **store files**, and **talk to hardware**.
* Many servers on the internet run on Linux because it is:
  ✔ Free
  ✔ Fast
  ✔ Safe
  ✔ Easy for automation

So Linux = **the boss of the computer**.

# 🛠️ **Why DevOps Engineers Use Linux?**

DevOps means:
➡️ Automating things
➡️ Managing servers
➡️ Deploying applications
➡️ Keeping systems running

Linux is the **#1 OS for servers and DevOps tools**.

Below is the **Use of Linux for DevOps engineers explained like for a 10-year-old**:

---

## ⭐ 1. **Most servers in the world use Linux**

Websites, apps, databases → all run on Linux.

So a DevOps engineer MUST know Linux to manage those servers.

---

## ⭐ 2. **You write scripts (bash) to automate tasks**

DevOps = Automation.
Linux lets you write **shell scripts** to do things like:

* Install packages
* Take backups
* Restart services
* Check CPU, RAM
* Deploy applications

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Deploying app automatically..."
```

---

## ⭐ 3. **Tools used in DevOps run on Linux**

Almost all DevOps tools are made for Linux:

* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Jenkins
* Terraform
* Ansible
* Git
* AWS CLI

These work much better on Linux than on Windows.

---

## ⭐ 4. **Linux is stable and secure**

Companies like **Google, Amazon, Facebook** use Linux because it:

✔ Doesn’t crash
✔ Handles high traffic
✔ Secure
✔ Customizable

So DevOps engineers love Linux.

---

## ⭐ 5. **You can manage servers using commands**

DevOps engineers mostly work on **virtual machines (EC2)** over SSH.
These servers run Linux.

You use Linux commands to:

* Create users
* Set permissions
* Check logs
* Monitor services
* Manage applications
* Fix issues

---

## ⭐ 6. **Linux makes deployments easier**

Automation pipelines (CI/CD) use Linux to:

* Build code
* Test applications
* Deploy to servers
* Run containers
