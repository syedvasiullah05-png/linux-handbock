# 🧑‍💻 **Set up Users and Groups for a Dev Team — Simple Explanation**

Think of your **Linux system** like a **big school**.

### 🎒 1. **Users = Students**

A *user* is like a *student* in the school.

* Every student has their **own username**.
* They get their **own place** to keep things (`/home/username`).
* They **log in** with their own name and password.

👉 **Why create users?**
So each person in the team has their **own space**, and they don’t mix files with each other.

---

### 👥 2. **Groups = Classrooms**

A *group* is like a **classroom** full of students.

* Many users can be inside **one group**.
* If you give permission to the **group**, all users inside it get the same access.

👉 **Why create groups?**
So you can give permissions to **all developers at once**, instead of giving to each one.

---

# 🛠️ **Commands (Explained Like for a Child)**

### ✏️ **1. Create a user**

```bash
sudo useradd dev1
```

This means:
➡️ “Linux, please create a new student named **dev1**.”

To set password:

```bash
sudo passwd dev1
```

---

### 🧩 **2. Create a group**

```bash
sudo groupadd devteam
```

This means:
➡️ “Create a new classroom called **devteam**.”

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **3. Add user to group**

```bash
sudo usermod -aG devteam dev1
```

This means:
➡️ “Put student **dev1** inside the classroom **devteam**.”

You can add more users:

```bash
sudo useradd dev2
sudo passwd dev2
sudo usermod -aG devteam dev2
```

---

### 📂 **4. Give the group permission to a project folder**

Create a folder:

```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/projectA
```

Change owner to the group:

```bash
sudo chown :devteam /opt/projectA
```

Means:
➡️ “This folder belongs to the **devteam classroom**.”

Allow group to read/write:

```bash
sudo chmod 770 /opt/projectA
```

Means:
➡️ “Only teacher (root) and devteam students can enter and write here.”

---

# 🎉 Final Result

✔ Users created
✔ Group created
✔ Users added to group
✔ Project folder permissions set

# 📂 Manage Permissions for Project Directories — Simple Explanation

Think of a **project directory** like a **toy box**.
You want to decide:

* Who can **open** the box
* Who can **put toys** inside
* Who can **remove toys**
* Who should **not touch it at all**

In Linux, we control this using **permissions**.

---

# 👤 Permissions Basics (Very Easy)

Every folder/file has 3 types of people:

1️⃣ **Owner** → the main person
2️⃣ **Group** → team members
3️⃣ **Others** → everyone else

Each can get 3 powers:

* **r** = read (look inside)
* **w** = write (change/add)
* **x** = execute (enter the folder)

---

 # 🛠️ Example: Managing Permissions for a Dev Team Project Folder

### 🧰 Step 1: Create project directory

```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/projectA
```

👉 Create a toy box called **projectA**.

---

### 🧰 Step 2: Set the group for this folder

If your dev group is called `devteam`:

```bash
sudo chown :devteam /opt/projectA
```

👉 Make **devteam** the owner group of the folder.

---

### 🧰 Step 3: Give correct permissions

Usually for a dev team:

* **Owner** = full access
* **Group** = full access
* **Others** = no access

Command:

```bash
sudo chmod 770 /opt/projectA
```

Meaning:

* **7** = rwx (owner full)
* **7** = rwx (group full)
* **0** = no permissions for others

👉 Only owner + devteam can enter/change files.

---

# 🎓 Understanding chmod (child-level)

🎯 **770** means:

| Who    | Number | Meaning                |
| ------ | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Owner  | 7      | read + write + execute |
| Group  | 7      | read + write + execute |
| Others | 0      | no access              |

It’s like:

* Owner: ✔ Can open, ✔ can add, ✔ can remove
* Group: ✔ Can open, ✔ can add, ✔ can remove
* Others: ❌ Cannot touch

---

# 🧹 Step 4 (Optional): Make files inside follow same group

```bash
sudo chmod g+s /opt/projectA
```

👉 All new files will automatically belong to **devteam**.

---

# 🎉 Final Result

✔ Project folder created
✔ Dev team group assigned
✔ Only dev team can read/write
✔ Others cannot enter
✔ New files automatically owned by the group

# 🧰 Install Required Packages (git, nginx, java)

Think of **Linux** like a **mobile phone**.
To use apps, you must **install** them.

In Linux, we install apps using the **package manager**.

---

# 📦 Packages We Need

Your DevOps basic tasks need these 3 tools:

1️⃣ **Git** → For code version control
2️⃣ **Nginx** → Web server
3️⃣ **Java** → To run Java applications

---

# 🛠️ How to Install Them (Very Simple)

## ✔ On **Ubuntu / Debian** (apt)

### 1. Update system (like refreshing the app store)

```bash
sudo apt update
```

---

### 2. Install Git

```bash
sudo apt install git -y
```

👉 “Please install Git.”

---

### 3. Install Nginx

```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

👉 “Please install Nginx web server.”

---

### 4. Install Java (default JDK)

```bash
sudo apt install default-jdk -y
```

👉 “Please install Java so I can run Java programs.”

---

## ✔ On **Amazon Linux / RHEL / CentOS** (yum or dnf)

### 1. Update system

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

---

### 2. Install Git

```bash
sudo yum install git -y
```

---

### 3. Install Nginx

```bash
sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y
```

(For CentOS/RHEL: `sudo yum install nginx -y`)

---

### 4. Install Java 17 (example)

```bash
sudo yum install java-17 -y
```

---

# 🎉 Final Result

After running these commands:

✔ Git installed
✔ Nginx installed and ready
✔ Java installed
✔ System updated
✔ All tools available for DevOps

# 🧠 Check System Info (Memory, CPU, Disks)

Think of your **Linux system** like a **human body**:

* **CPU** = Brain
* **Memory (RAM)** = Short-term memory
* **Disk** = Storage like a school bag

We use some easy commands to check how healthy the system is.

---

# 🧠 1. Check CPU (Brain)

### Command:

```bash
lscpu
```

👉 This shows:

* How many **cores** the CPU has
* How fast it is
* CPU architecture

Another quick check:

```bash
top
```

or

```bash
htop
```

👉 Shows CPU usage live (like a heartbeat monitor).

---

# 🧠 2. Check Memory (RAM)

### Command:

```bash
free -h
```

👉 Shows:

* Total memory
* Used memory
* Free memory

`-h` means “human readable” → makes numbers easy to understand.

---

# 🧠 3. Check Disk (Storage)

### Command:

```bash
df -h
```

👉 Shows:

* How much disk is used
* How much is free
* Which partitions exist

To check disk details (names, sizes):

```bash
lsblk
```

---

# 🧰 Extra Helpful Commands

### Check overall system info:

```bash
uname -a
```

### Check OS version:

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

### Check hardware info:

```bash
sudo lshw
```

(If installed)

---

# 🎉 Final Result

Using these commands, you can see:

✔ CPU details
✔ Live CPU usage
✔ Total memory and free memory
✔ Disk space and usage
✔ OS version and system hardware
