# 🐧 **Linux Basics (Very Simple Explanation)**

### ⭐ **1. What is Linux?**

Think of Linux like a **big playground** where your computer plays.
It helps your computer **run programs**, **store files**, and **do tasks**.

---

# 👤 **Users & Groups**

### ⭐ **2. What is a User?**

A *user* is like a **person who is allowed to enter the playground**.
Each user has their **own space** and permissions.

### ⭐ Why do we create users?

So that **everyone has their own separate place**, and **no one disturbs others’ work**.

Example command:

```bash
sudo adduser dev1
```

# 👥 **Groups**

### ⭐ What is a Group?

A *group* is like a **team**.
Many users can be in one group and share files easily.

Example:

```bash
sudo groupadd developers
sudo usermod -aG developers dev1
```

# 🔐 **Permissions**

### ⭐ What are permissions?

Permissions tell:

* who can **read** the file (just look),
* who can **write** (change it),
* who can **execute** (run it).

Example:

```bash
chmod 755 filename
```

**Simple meaning:**

* Owner can do everything
* Others can only read + run

# 📦 **Packages**

### ⭐ What is a package?

A package is like an **app** (software).
We install packages to use them.

Example:

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```
